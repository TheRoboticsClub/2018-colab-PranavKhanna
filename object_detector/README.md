<h1>The aim of this project is to integrate the tensorflow api for object detection with jderobot components.</h1>

<h3>In this project I have replicated an existing code of my fellow collaborator Nacho at Jderobot.</h3>
<p>To run the object detector the following commands have to be fed into the terminal.<br>
1)cameraserver cameraserver.cfg<br>
2)python objectdetector.py objectdetector.yml 
</p>
